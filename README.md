# Student-Progress-Tracking-System

This is a project that allows students to set question-solving targets for each course, track their progress by entering solved question counts, and upload photos of questions they couldn’t solve. Teachers can view and respond to these questions with image-based solutions, and parents can monitor their child’s progress through a read-only interface.
